					<a href="files/statement.pdf"><h3>Plenty of bands that no longer exist are being forgotten as time goes on, and without a proper list or archive, itâ€™s hard for people to find information about them or learn about their music. I aim to create an accessible, organized list of forgotten bands from the 90s to the end of the 2010s, including basic details about their history, members, and music. This will help keep their memory alive and make it easier for others to discover them.</h3></a>
